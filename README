TreeAcordion 1.2
=================
this class takes a tree structure (by element id of by a passed element) and makes it tweakable with an Acordion effect.
it takes the following paramaters as options:
	branchClass : a class to identify all the branches.
	openerClass : a class to identify the open-close handler. 
				  if supplied, it will assume the handler to be assigned to the first sibling branch
	branchContrainer : a selector to use for identifing the container for the branch and its handler. 
					   note that this is by default 'li', and yu should only change it if, for some reason,
					   you are not using the ul->li->ul layout
	acordOpenFunction  : a function to use in case you prefer a different effect for the tree opening
	acordCloseFunction : a function to use in case you prefer a different effect for the tree closing
	multiple : whether to allow multiple branches to b opened at the same time

	Events:
		acord-opened : fired when a branch is opened. returns the opened branch
		acord-closed : fired when a branch is closed. returns the closed branch
		handled-opened : fired when a handled branch is opened. returns the handler
		handled-closed : fired when a handled branch is closed. returns the handler
	
		
the default layout for this class is a root-ul, containing multiple lis, each containing only one branch, which in turn is a ul etc.
you might want for whatever reason to choose a different setup. the only limition that i can think of is that each branchContainer should only
hold one branch. another will simply be ignored.
